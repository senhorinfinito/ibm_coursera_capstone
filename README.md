# IBM Data Science Professional Certification-  Capstone Project 

Today, I've completed all 9 courses from the 𝗜𝗕𝗠 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.
It took 30 days to complete this milestone. This course was well
crafted for beginners and gave a brief introduction to
the Data science pipeline. The long hours of staring at the practice Jupyter
Notebooks gave me frequent headaches but each and every second of it was worth
it as the notebooks helped me understand the basics perfectly.



As part of Capstone I have worked on EDA project [here](https://github.com/senhorinfinito/ibm_coursera_capstone/blob/master/week5/week5all.ipynb)
